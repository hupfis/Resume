# For recruiters

This is my curriculum vitae. It is based on a common, machine-readable data format named JSON and is automatically rendered to PDF and a website on every update of this data. You can download the result from [GitHub](https://github.com/saxx/Resume/releases).

# For developers

This is my curriculum vitae defined using [JSON Resume format](https://jsonresume.org). This work is based on the work of Hannes Sachsenhofer (https://github.com/saxx/resume). All you see here is inspired by [Steven Edouard](http://resume.stevenedouard.com/). Take a look at [his repository](https://github.com/sedouard/resume) for some more detailled information, especially on how to run this on Azure Websites and listen to [this podcast](http://hanselminutes.com/457/starting-with-continuous-integration-in-the-cloud-with-steven-edouard) if you want some background information.
